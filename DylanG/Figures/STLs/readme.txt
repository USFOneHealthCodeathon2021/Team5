The 10 STLs from the last day (day 113). Names are in ascending order, separeted by high outliers and
low outliers. For low_n, low_1 represents the bacteria with the smallest residual and low_5 represents
the bacteria with the "highest" residual (highest of the 5 low outliers). For high_n, high_1 is the smallest
of the high outliers and high_5 is the largest of the high outliers (and all residuals for the last day).
